          <h3>Rogue planet</h3>
          <h4>A rogue planet, also known as a free-floating planet, is an exoplanet that does not orbit any star and instead drifts through interstellar space. These planets can vary in size, from Earth-sized to massive gas giants. They are often challenging to detect because they do not emit their own light. Rogue planets may form either through ejection from their parent star systems or by independent formation in interstellar space, making them intriguing objects for scientific study. Despite their extreme cold and lack of a host star, they provide valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution.</h4>
